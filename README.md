# Tank Game
My first attempt to make a Tank Game. It will be an open-world head-to-head tank fight with AI,terrain and advanced contro system in UE 4.Feel free to help with the mechanics or the ideas.
This project for me is a way to understand how UE 4 works.

## Game Design Document
*Concept
-> A simple head-to-head tank fight.
-> A basic terrain that can provide cover.(TODO a more complex terrain with secret paths, an interactive enviroment.)
-> Give an intense experience to the player.
-> Do not make it boring.
*Rules
-> You can move anywhere in the terrain.
-> Both players start with finite health and ammo.(TODO the player can pick up ammo or health or any other consumable.)
-> Each hit take away health.(TODO the health to depent on the part of the tank that the projectile hit.)
-> The last player standing wins.
*Requirements
-> A ton of SFX, a ton of Static mesh, a ton texture, a ton music. 
If anyone knows any site with free SFX,Static Meshes,Texture etc please inform me.


## Stages
* Set a GitHub Repo
